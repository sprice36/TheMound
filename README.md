## Creating The Mound

Initially we had ideas of what the website will contain and how we want to present it to the users. We found
APIs that were full of data and had to decide what data do the fans want the most. We narrowed down to 
certain statistics and proceeded from there.  

## Using The Mound

The website can be accessed by any web browser on a PC, Mac or mobile phone. When the user accesses
the website where they can click on a variety of options including searching for their
favorite players, teams or view their teams schedules.

1. Select your favorite team in the left most option to view the players on the current roster for this season. 

2. Select your favorite player's position in the next option to view all the players at the specific position.

3. Select today or any other date to view all the teams scheduled to play that day.

## Where we struck out..
There was some complications in appending multiple Google maps for each of the game's 
locations to the div. 

## Missing features.
-Google Maps API

## A sincere thanks to <a href = "https://developer.sportradar.com/">Sportradar.com</a> for allowing the use of their MLB API.
