## Creating The Mound

Initially we had ideas of what the website will contain and how we want to present it to the users. We found
APIs that were full of data and had to decide what data do the fans want the most. We narrowed down to 
certain statistics and proceeded from there.  

## Using The Mound

The website can be accessed by any web browser on a PC, Mac or mobile phone. When the user accesses
the website where they can click on a variety of options including searching for their
favorite players, teams or view their teams schedules.

## Where we struck out..
There was some complications in appending multiple Google maps for each of the game's 
locations to the div. Also the baseball APIs we used wasnt as smooth as we had hoped. 
Other than that it was a great learning experience.

## Missing features.
-Google Maps API
